I also have experience with Application Design with Wireframes, Mock-Ups and Interactive Storyboard projects (Mobile Applications, Figma)

This project scenario was centred around POGS (Produce Owners Group System), a (hypothetical) fresh produce delivery company. Vendors who are interested in selling their produce can register an account with POGS, providing the contact person's name, phone number, business name, business phone number, and ABN. Once they have an account, they can sign in (using their ABN and password) to manage their account. They can add a product to their list, update its details, and delete a product.

This application for the aforementioned POGS is an online shopping mobile app, displaying elements such as a welcome heading, image, options to select fruits, vegetables and quantity through dropdowns, and calculating the total amount.
